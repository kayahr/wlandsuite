      <action dev="k" type="update" date="2010-08-25"">
        Wasteland Suite is now compiled with Java 6.
      </action>
      <action dev="k" type="update">
        Implemented demolition flag in item lists.
      </action>
      <action dev="k" type="update">
        Item type is now handled as a enum internally instead of an integer
        but XML file still uses an integer.
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="1.3.0" date="2009-10-07" desc="Minor update">
      <action dev="k" type="add">
        Added full support for the external data files used by Displacer's 
        hacked EXE.
      </action>
      <action dev="k" type="fix">
        Patch for safe check (20) on map 4 was not working correctly. 
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="1.2.0" date="2006-09-24" desc="Major update">
      <action dev="k" type="add">
        Added full read and write support for the game files. unpackgame
        and packgame can be used to edit the maps in every respect (but within
        the limits of wasteland) with a simple text editor. A good XML
        editor is recommended to take advantage of the documented XML schema
        file.
      </action>
      <action dev="k" type="add">
        Added an extractmaps program which can be used to extract the maps
        of wasteland as PNG files. It reads the tilemaps from the game files,
        the tiles from the allhtds files and the sprites from the ic0_9.wlf
        file and then merges them into graphical maps and saves them into PNG
        files.
      </action>
      <action dev="k" type="fix">
        Replaced unpackwlf and packwlf with unpackmasks, packmasks,
        unpacksprites and packsprites because I found out that the two WLF
        files of wasteland have different formats and ic0_9.wlf does 
        contain sprite images and not animation bit masks. 
      </action>
      <action dev="k" type="fix">
        Fixed fixwloffsets problems with different EXE files unpacked with
        different EXE unpackers.
