Usage: unpackmasks [OPTION]... DIRECTORY [INPUT]
Unpacks masks from a masks.wlf file into a directory

  -W, --width    The width of the masks in the masks.wlf file (Default: 16)
  -H, --height   The height of the masks in the masks.wlf file (Default: 16)
  -q, --quantity The number of masks in the masks.wlf file (Default: Auto or 10)
  -d, --debug    Shows stacktrace when an error occurs
  -h, --help     Display help and exit
  -V, --version  Display version and exit
  
The first parameter must be the name of the directory in which the bit masks
should be unpacked. The program creates the directory automatically if it does
not yet exist.

The second parameter specifies the filename of the file to read. If
the parameter is missing or is "-" then the input is read from stdin.

A masks.wlf file does not contain any information about mask dimensions. So if 
the masks in the file are not the default 16x16 pixels then you have to use the
width and height parameters to tell unpackmasks the real size of the masks.

If you are reading input from stdin then you must also specify the number of
masks to read. The default is 10 masks.
