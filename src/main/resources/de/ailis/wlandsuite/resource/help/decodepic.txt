Usage: decodepic [OPTION]... [INPUT [OUTPUT]]
Converts a Wasteland PIC file to a standard image format file

  -W, --width    The width of the PIC file (Default: 288)
  -H, --height   The height of the PIC file (Default: 128)
  -f, --format   The image format if writing to stdout (Default: PNG)
  -d, --debug    Shows stacktrace when an error occurs
  -h, --help     Display help and exit
  -V, --version  Display version and exit
  
Without any parameters decodepic reads the input from stdin and writes it
to stdout. With one parameter the wasteland pic is read from the specified
file and the output is written to stdout. If you specify two parameters then
the input is read from the first file and the output is written to the second 
file. You can also specify a minus character ("-") as filename which also means
reading to stdin or writing to stdout.

If you have selected to write the output to stdout then you have to use the
format parameter to tell decodepic in which image format you want the output to
be. Default is PNG. What formats are available on your system depends on
the installed ImageIO plugins. Normally you can select PNG, BMP and JPEG. When
you have installed the JAI ImageIO plugins from Sun then you can also use GIF
and TIFF.

A PIC file does not contain any information about picture dimensions. So if the
size of the PIC file is not the default 288x128 pixels then you have to use the
width and height parameters to tell decodepic the real size of the picture.
