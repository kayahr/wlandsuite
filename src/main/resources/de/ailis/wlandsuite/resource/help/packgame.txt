Usage: packgame [OPTION]... DIRECTORY [OUTPUT]
Packs maps, savegame and shop item list XML files into a game file

  -D, --disk     The disk index (0 for game1 or 1 for game2)
                 Default is automatically determined by looking at the number
                 of maps.
  -d, --debug    Shows stacktrace when an error occurs
  -h, --help     Display help and exit
  -V, --version  Display version and exit

The first parameter must be the name of the directory which holds the
XML files describing the maps, the savegame and ths shop item lists. This 
directory must contain maps with the filename map[00-21].xml, a savegame.xml 
and shop item list files with the filename shopitems[0-2].xml.

The easiest way to initialize a game directory is using unpackgame to unpack 
the original data from the game.

The second parameter specifies the filename of the game file to write. If
the parameter is missing or is "-" then the output is written to stdout.
