Usage: packtileset [OPTION]... DIRECTORY [OUTPUT]
Packs a tileset directory into an external tileset file (For the hacked EXE)

  -d, --debug    Shows stacktrace when an error occurs
  -h, --help     Display help and exit
  -V, --version  Display version and exit

The first parameter must be the name of the directory which holds the
tilesets. This directory must contain tile images as PNGs.
The names must be numbered starting with 000. For example: 000.png. 

The easiest way to initialize a tileset directory is using unpacktileset to
unpack an already present external tileset file or unpackhtds to unpack 
the original tilesets from the game.

The second parameter specifies the filename of the tileset file to write. If
the parameter is missing or is "-" then the output is written to stdout.
