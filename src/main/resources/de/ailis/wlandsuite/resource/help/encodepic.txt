Usage: encodepic [OPTION]... [INPUT [OUTPUT]]
Converts a standard image format file into a Wasteland PIC file

  -d, --debug    Shows stacktrace when an error occurs
  -h, --help     Display help and exit
  -V, --version  Display version and exit

Without any parameters encodepic reads the input from stdin and writes it
to stdout. With one parameter the image is read from the specified file and the 
output is written to stdout. If you specify two parameters then the input is 
read from the first file and the output is written to the second file. You can 
also specify a minus character ("-") as filename which also means reading to 
stdin or writing to stdout.
