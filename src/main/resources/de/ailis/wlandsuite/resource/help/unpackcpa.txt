Usage: unpackcpa [OPTION]... DIRECTORY [INPUT]
Unpacks a Compressed Picture Animation (CPA) into a directory

  -W, --width      The width of the picture (Default: 288)
  -d, --debug      Shows stacktrace when an error occurs
  -h, --help       Display help and exit
  -V, --version    Display version and exit
  
The first parameter must be the name of the directory in which the animation
should be unpacked. The program creates the directory automatically if it does
not yet exist.

The second parameter specifies the filename of the CPA file to read. If
the parameter is missing or is "-" then the input is read from stdin.
  
A CPA file does not contain any information about picture dimensions. So if the
size of the CPA file is not the default 288x128 pixels then you have to use the
width parameter to give unpackcpa a clue about the real size of the picture. 
The height is calculated automatically.
