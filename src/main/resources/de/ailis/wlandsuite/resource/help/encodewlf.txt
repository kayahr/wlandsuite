Usage: encodewlf [OPTION]... [INPUT [OUTPUT]]
Converts a standard image format file into a Wasteland WLF file

  -m, --masks    The number of masks (Default is automatically calculated)
  -d, --debug    Shows stacktrace when an error occurs
  -h, --help     Display help and exit
  -V, --version  Display version and exit

Without any parameters encodepic reads the input from stdin and writes it
to stdout. With one parameter the input is read from the specified file and the 
output is written to stdout. If you specify two parameters then the input is 
read from the first file and the output is written to the second file. You can 
also specify a minus character ("-") as filename which also means reading to 
stdin or writing to stdout.

The number of masks is determined automatically but this only works when the
mask height is the same as the width (Which is normally the case because
Wasteland masks are 16x16). If your masks have different sizes then you may
want to specify the masks parameter.
