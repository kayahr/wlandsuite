Usage: packpic [OPTION]... DIRECTORY [OUTPUT]
Packs an animation into an external file for Displacer's hacked EXE.

  -d, --debug    Shows stacktrace when an error occurs
  -h, --help     Display help and exit
  -V, --version  Display version and exit

The first parameter must be the name of the directory which holds the
encounter animation. This directory must contain a base frame in 000.png and 
for each animation frame set a numbered subdirectory starting with 000. Each 
animation frame set directory must contain the frames with numbered file names 
starting with 001.png and an animation.txt file which contains two numbers per 
line. The first number is the delay and the second number the frame to display.

The easiest way to initialize an animation directory is using unpackpic to
unpack an existing external animation file or the unpackpics program to unpack
the original animations from the game.

The second parameter specifies the filename of the animation file to write. If
the parameter is missing or is "-" then the output is written to stdout.

Please note that this tool is only useful if you work with Displacer's hacked
EXE. If you are working with the original files then you have to use
the packpics program to pack a new allpics1 or allpics2 file.
