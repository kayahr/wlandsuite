Usage: packwlf [OPTION]... DIRECTORY [OUTPUT]
Packs bit masks into a WLF file.

  -d, --debug    Shows stacktrace when an error occurs
  -h, --help     Display help and exit
  -V, --version  Display version and exit

The first parameter must be the name of the directory which holds the
bit masks. This directory must contain bit masks in files names 000.png, 001.png
and so on.

The easiest way to initialize a bit mask directory is using unpackwlf to
unpack the original masks.wlf or ic0_9.wlf from the game.

The second parameter specifies the filename of the WLF file to write. If
the parameter is missing or is "-" then the output is written to stdout.
