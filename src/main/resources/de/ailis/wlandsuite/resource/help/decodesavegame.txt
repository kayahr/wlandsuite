Usage: decodesavegame [OPTION]... [INPUT [OUTPUT]]
Converts an external savegame file (for Displacer's hacked EXE) to XML

  -d, --debug    Shows stacktrace when an error occurs
  -h, --help     Display help and exit
  -V, --version  Display version and exit
  
Without any parameters decodesavegame reads the input from stdin and writes it
to stdout. With one parameter the input is read from the specified file and the 
output is written to stdout. If you specify two parameters then the input is 
read from the first file and the output is written to the second file. You can 
also specify a minus character ("-") as filename which also means reading to 
stdin or writing to stdout.

Please note that this tool is only useful if you work with Displacer's hacked
EXE. If you are working with the original files then you have to use
the unpackgame program to extract the savegames from the game1 and game2 
files.
