Usage: decryptgame [OPTION]... [INPUT [OUTPUT]]
Decrypts a gameX file.

  -d, --debug    Shows stacktrace when an error occurs
  -h, --help     Display help and exit
  -V, --version  Display version and exit

Without any parameters decryptgame reads the input from stdin and writes it
to stdout. With one parameter the game file is read from the specified
file and the output is written to stdout. If you specify two parameters then
the input is read from the first file and the output is written to the second 
file. You can also specify a minus character ("-") as filename which also means
reading to stdin or writing to stdout.
