Usage: packhtds [OPTION]... DIRECTORY [OUTPUT]
Packs a tileset directory into a allhtds file

  -D, --disk     The disk index (0 for allhtds1 or 1 for allhtds2)
                 Default is automatically determined by looking at the 
                 number of tilesets.
  -d, --debug    Shows stacktrace when an error occurs
  -h, --help     Display help and exit
  -V, --version  Display version and exit

The first parameter must be the name of the directory which holds the
tilesets. This directory must contain numbered subdirectories for each tileset 
starting with 000. Each tileset directory must contain tile images as PNGs.
The names must be numbered starting with 000. For example: 000.png. 

The easiest way to initialize a tileset directory is using unpackhtds to
unpack the original tilesets from the game.

The second parameter specifies the filename of the HTDS file to write. If
the parameter is missing or is "-" then the output is written to stdout.

Please note that you must run the fixwloffsets program after you have modified
the tileset files of wasteland because the MSQ offsets in the allhtds files
are now most likely different to the original offsets hardcoded in the wl.exe
file.
